# ü§ñ AICommit

**AICommit** is a streamlined AI-assisted Git commit message tool, built for speed and semantic clarity. It uses OpenAI to analyze your changes and generate intelligent, well-formatted commit messages ‚Äî so you can stay focused on writing code, not prose.

> üß† Derived from the full-featured [MAIASS](https://github.com/vsmash/maiass) script, AICommit is stripped down to do one thing extremely well: suggest commit messages based on your code diff.

## üß™ Usage

```bash
aicommit
```

AICommit will:

1. Detect your staged changes

5. Commit your changes

> It will **not** bump versions, merge branches, or update changelogs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Set your OpenAI key and preferences via environment variables or a `.env` file in the repo root:

```bash
export MAIASS_OPENAI_TOKEN=your-api-key
export MAIASS_OPENAI_MODE=ask
export MAIASS_OPENAI_COMMIT_MESSAGE_STYLE=bullet
```

Alternatively, create a `.env` file:

```dotenv
MAIASS_OPENAI_TOKEN=your-api-key
MAIASS_OPENAI_MODE=autosuggest
MAIASS_OPENAI_COMMIT_MESSAGE_STYLE=conventional
```

## ‚ú® Prompt Customization

Want full control over the AI prompt?

Create a `.maiass.prompt` file:

```txt
Write a git commit message summarizing the following changes in conventional commit format. Use past tense.

Git diff:
$git_diff
```

## üîê OpenAI Access

You'll need an OpenAI API key. You can generate one from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and export it as:

```bash
export MAIASS_OPENAI_TOKEN=sk-...
```

## üßº Clean Design Philosophy

This version does **not**:
- Handle changelogs
- Manage versions
- Create or merge branches
- Require Git Flow

It's a focused tool for intelligent commits ‚Äî nothing more.
